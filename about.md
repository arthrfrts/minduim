_Minduim_ is a charming blog theme for Jekyll. Based on the classic Posterous default theme, _Minduim_ offers a two-column layout and support for pagination, archives and SEO tags.

The theme is named after the translation for the _Peanuts_ comic strip in Brazil, which is also how it was translated the nickname Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown. You'll notice some subtle homages to the comic strip in the theme. I hope you appreciate!
