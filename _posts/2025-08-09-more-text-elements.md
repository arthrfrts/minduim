## Footnotes

Footnotes are like dog treats --- you never know when you'll need one[^1]. Charlie Brown thinks they're useful for adding extra thoughts[^2] without cluttering up the main text[^3].

Linus believes that footnotes demonstrate the complex nature of written communication[^4].

## Abbreviations and Acronyms

Even Snoopy knows that <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> are fundamental for building websites. Then you add <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> to the mix.

## Horizontal Rules with Content

Text before the first divider.

---

Text between dividers - this tests how horizontal rules segment content.

***

Final section of text after the last divider.

[^1]: Woof! This footnote is approved by the Red Baron himself.
[^2]: Charlie Brown would say "Good grief!" if he knew how many footnotes were in this post.
[^3]: Even footnotes can be **bold** and contain [links to the pumpkin patch](https://example.com).
[^4]: Linus says that footnotes are like security blankets for writers - they provide `comfort` and additional `support` when you need to say more without interrupting the main flow of thought. Sometimes the most important things are found in the smallest details.
